## Hi! My name is Tanzeela

I am a Computer Science Major with a Management Information Systems minor at George Mason University, on track to graduate in 2027.

My interests lie in the combination of Business and Tech, and I am willing to explore different tech fields as a previous SDE intern at Amazon!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fellowship with Break Through Tech with Cornell Tech where I am learning Machine Learning Foundations.
